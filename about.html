        <h2> Description</h2>
        <a>As a group Team 6 will create the E-section marcher product during our CIS-490 class. This product will be allowed online so that cadet 
            within VMI will have the ability to take role online. We have created has four main groups: cadet, secretary, commandant staff, and professor. 
            Each group has its same functionality as compared to paper section marcher process. For the cadet side, they will be able to see exactly what 
            classes they are section marchers in, See your history of section marchers submitted, Instructions page, Attendance and Your cadet info.
            The Secretary side of things will be able to view the submitted attendances per day, search by words and find cadets or courses. Commandants staff 
            will be able to view the full report of submitted attendances per day, search by letters typed in and find cadets or courses. The professor side of 
            things will be able to take roll if the top three section marchers aren't there. As a group we have got our product reviewed by multiple different 
            professional and peer-related groups. Each user has an instructions page that explains how to use the system and is there for VMI's sake in making 
            sure that tolerance is not an excuse.
